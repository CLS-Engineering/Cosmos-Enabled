Sign In
==========
The service uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory accounts for authenticating its users. Azure Active Directory is cloud hosted version of Microsoft Active Directory technology. It is used by over 400 million users worldwide so chances are that it is already used by your organization.

Check out the following scenarios for help:

We have Azure Active Directory
------------------------------
If you already have Azure Active Directory you should be good to go. Press the Sign In link and you're redirected to the login service. Use your account to sign in. While using the login service provided by Microsoft your password is never sent to us.

After signing in you should be taken back to our service. In case you're new user you're asked to register a new account which you must do in order to continue the use of the service.

If sign in fails there are three common cases.

* You've entered wrong credentials
* Your account is blocked by your company policy from using 3rd party services. Consult your company's IT support organization for change or exception to the policy.
* Login service is experiencing temporary problems

If you fail to sign in :doc:`let us know </support/contact>` and we will do our best to assist you.

I don't know if we have Azure Active Directory
----------------------------------------------
In case you're not sure if your user account is connected to Azure Active Directory you may still try signing in with it (see :ref:`a-label`).

If you fail to sign in with your account the chances are you don't have Azure Active Directory account. See :ref:`c-label` for obtaining one.

We don't have Azure Active Directory or our company policy prevents using 3rd party services
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your organization is not willing to start using Azure Active Directory or your company policy prevents using 3rd party services we may provide you with account(s) to use. :doc:`Contact us </support/contact>` and let us know of your situation and we will do our best to assist you.
